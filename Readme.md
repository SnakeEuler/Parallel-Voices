# Parallel Voices
### Real-Time Voice Generation for Game Characters

## Overview
This project aims to develop a real-time voice generation system for game characters, leveraging advanced AI technologies to create natural and expressive speech. The system integrates seamlessly with popular game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine, providing dynamic emotion and accent modulation for immersive gaming experiences.

## Project Goals
- **Real-Time Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Generate lifelike and dynamic voices for game characters in real-time.
- **Emotion and Accent Modulation:** Adjust speech to reflect different emotions and accents dynamically.
- **Seamless Game Engine Integration:** Integrate with Unity and Unreal Engine for easy deployment in games.
- **Optimized Performance:** Utilize ONNX and Intelâ€™s OpenVINO toolkit to ensure high performance across various hardware platforms.

## Technology Stack
- **AI Frameworks:** TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Model Formats:** ONNX
- **Optimization Tools:** OpenVINO Toolkit, ONNX Runtime with OpenVINO EP
- **Game Engines:** Unity, Unreal Engine
- **Supporting Libraries:** Hugging Face Transformers, WebRTC, NLTK/spaCy
- **Agents and Frameworks:** LLAMA 3, LangChain, LangGraph
